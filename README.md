## About The Project

A final project for the Machine Learning (ENGR-UH	4560) course taught at New York University Abu Dhabi.

Every once in a while, you may be faced with the dreaded decision of where to study. We use past traffic data from various study locations across campus to predict where the best study location may be, whether this means high traffic, for those who enjoy company, or low traffic, for those who want quiet. Either way, you'll know before anyone knows.
